Domain:** Social media Context and Content: In a fairly recent move by Youtube, it announced the decision to hide the number of dislikes from users around November 2021. However, the official YouTube Data API allowed you to get information about dislikes until December 13, 2021. Doing an EDA-exercise can help to draw some unseen insights from this dataset.
